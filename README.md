# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-using-Linear-Regression

Welcome to my Machine Learning project repository! This repository showcases two projects where I applied foundational machine learning algorithms to analyze datasets and predict outcomes. Each project demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and applying machine learning models.

Projects
1. Profit Prediction for 1000 Companies
Objective:
Predict company profits based on key features such as R&D spending, administration costs, and marketing expenditures.

Dataset:
A dataset containing financial and operational data for 1000 companies.

Key Features:
R&D Spend
Administration Costs
Marketing Spend
Region
Machine Learning Model:
Linear Regression: Used to build a predictive model for profit estimation.
Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and standardized features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized correlations between variables to identify impactful features.
Model Implementation: Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model to predict profits.
Results:
Achieved an accurate prediction of company profits, with insights into which factors most influence profitability.

2. Student Performance Prediction
Objective:
Classify students' performance outcomes based on input features like study hours, attendance, and other performance indicators.

Dataset:
A dataset of student performance records.

Key Features:
Study Hours
Attendance
Participation Scores
Prior Grades
Machine Learning Model:
Logistic Regression: Used to classify students' performance index (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical variables and scaled numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and patterns related to student performance.
Model Implementation: Developed and evaluated a Logistic Regression model for classification.
Results:
Built a model that effectively predicts studentsâ€™ performance, helping identify key factors that contribute to academic success.
